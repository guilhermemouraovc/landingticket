where's my @featured.plan.md

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking where their `featured.plan.md` file is. I can see in the attached files that there is a file called `featured.plan.md` (shown as `\featured.plan.md`), but let me check if this file exists in the project structure.

Looking at the project layout, I don't see `featured.plan.md` listed in the root directory or anywhere else. However, the file was attached to the conversation, so it must exist somewhere.

Let me search for this file to see where it's actually located.</details></think>

I can see that `featured.plan.md` was attached to this conversation, but let me check where it's actually located in your workspace.

Tool use: **file_search**

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "featured.plan.md" • **2** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `\featured.plan.md` |
| `\featured.plan.md` |

</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The file search shows it as `\featured.plan.md` which means it's in the root directory. Let me try to read it to confirm it exists and its location.</details></think>

---

Could not find file 'featured.plan.md' in the workspace.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Interesting - the file appears to be at `\featured.plan.md` with a leading backslash. Let me try reading it with that path.</details></think>

---

Could not find file '\featured.plan.md' in the workspace.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>That's interesting - the file shows up in the search but can't be read. Let me check the workspace root to see what files are actually there.</details></think>

---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The `featured.plan.md` file doesn't appear in the actual directory listing. It seems the file is attached to the conversation but may not actually exist in the workspace. It could be:

1. A file that was deleted
2. A file in a parent directory (outside the workspace)
3. A virtual/temporary file attached to this conversation

Let me inform the user about this situation.</details></think>

Your `@featured.plan.md` file appears to have been **attached to this conversation** (I can see its contents), but it **doesn't actually exist in your workspace directory**.

The file is not present in your project root:
```
c:\Users\gmvc\OneDrive\Área de Trabalho\TicketPE\Landing\landingticket\landingticket-1\
```

This could mean:
1. **It was deleted** from the workspace but is still referenced in the conversation
2. **It exists in a parent directory** outside your current workspace
3. **It's a virtual/temporary file** that was attached to Cursor but not saved to disk

The plan file contains instructions for updating the "Ver detalhes" button in the featured event section of `IndexPage.vue`. Would you like me to:

1. Help you implement the changes described in the plan?
2. Create the `featured.plan.md` file in your workspace root with the content shown?
3. Search for where this file might actually be located?
